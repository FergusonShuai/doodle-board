## Doodle Board

### [Demo](https://fergusonshuai.github.io/doodle-board)

An online doodle pad allowing you to draw whatever you want!

Inspired by Maksim Ivanov's [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLESHMJ-bI0). Re-wrote it in typescript and applied some styles to make it a little bit less shabby.

### Some features:

- [x] Add a button to clear the entire drawing area.
- [x] Add a button to download your drawing as a `.png` file.
- [ ] Allow user to change stroke color and thickness.
